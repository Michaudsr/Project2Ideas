In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. Tutor app. When a user searches for a tutor, it will instantly connect them with tutors online and in their local area.
2. Mental health app. When a user searches for mental support groups, or psychiatric help it will connect them with local support and online support.
3. Software development start up app. When a user wants to be involed in a start up/development project they can search for start ups and non profits to offer their services to.
